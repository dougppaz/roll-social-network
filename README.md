**roll social network** is an open source project under the [MIT](LICENSE) license developed with the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) frameworks.


## Architecture

### Rolls, Social and Timeline

In our social network, a community unit is called **roll**. Users can join a **roll** by creating a profile on it. Once associated, the user has access to the timeline and can interact by liking other users' posts, as well as collaborating by publishing their own content.

Entity-relationship model:

### Auth

Access to our social network rolls requires authentication. To simplify and solve some problems, authentication linked to the customer's phone number was chosen.

Advantages of the chosen authentication model:

- Simplicity. The user does not need to set or remember a password or have a recovery email.
- Security. Access can only be done with the verification code sent at each login or by granting it to a third party.
- Real people. We guarantee, in most cases, that the clients is a real person and not a robot. With this we can also have legal applications, since the data uploaded to the social network can be linked to a real person.

#### OTP time-based

Users, after validating the time-based OTP code, can authenticate using just the code generated by the 2FA application.

### Watcher (WebSocket)

Watcher is a WebSocket solution for real-time state update.

### Protected Media with NGINX X-Accel

When the `MEDIA_PATH_AS_NGINX_ACCEL` flag is enabled, the `/media/` endpoint responds, for authenticated users, with the status code 201 and with the `X-Accel-Redirect` header. With this you can protect media files against unauthenticated users.

Read more about X-Accel in the [NGINX documentation](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/x-accel/).

See the concept applied in the [NGINX media conf file](nginx.medias.default.conf).

## Settings and Environment Vars

This project follow The [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology so all settings can be defined through environment variables.

All settings were centralized in the [settings.py](rollsocialnetwork/settings.py) file and can be defined by environment variables due to the [python-decople](https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/) [config object](https://github.com/HBNetwork/python-decouple?tab=readme-ov-file#usage).
